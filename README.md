## Movir: A Movie App with Jetpack Compose (WIP)

Movir is a single-screen movie app built with Jetpack Compose, a modern UI framework for Android. It showcases popular movies retrieved from TMDb (The Movie Database) API.

**Features:**

* **Modern UI with Jetpack Compose:** Leverages Compose for a declarative and efficient UI with smooth animations.
* **TMDb API Integration:** Fetches popular movie data using Retrofit for network calls. **Please note:**
The API key used in this demo project is retrieved from a public source (GeeksforGeeks) for illustration purposes only.
* **Shimmer Effect:** Displays a shimmer effect while movie data is loading, providing a visually appealing placeholder.
* **Movie Cards:** Displays movie posters with titles, genres, release dates, and ratings.
* **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Uses `Resource` sealed class to represent success or error states during data fetching.
* **Dependency Injection with Hilt:** Manages dependencies with Hilt for better code organization and testability.

**Current Status:**

This is a work-in-progress (WIP) project demonstrating the core functionalities of a movie app with Jetpack Compose.
